# Sinatra Template

Simple, general application template for the Sinatra Ruby Web Framework.

Much of this template has come from various tutorials.

## Setup

Change the database settings in `config/environments.rb` to match
that of your own.

By default, the template uses PostgreSQL but you can use any database
you like by changing the Gemfile and updating any references in
`config/environments.rb`.

## Usage

Once you've completed the setup phase you're free to develop how you want!
